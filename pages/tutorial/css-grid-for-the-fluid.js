      <h1>Looping && Iterating</h1>
      <ul>Learning goals:</ul>
      <li>describe and use loops</li>
      <li>describe and use different types of loops</li>
      <li>break down exactly how a loop iterates</li>

      <h2>Loops</h2>
      <p>
        A loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a specific
        condition is met. Use loops to run the same code over and over again,
        each time with a different value. There are lots of different loops, but
        they all do a version of the same thing. They repeat an action for a
        (usually specified) number of times. Multiple loops are great because
        they give us different ways to determine the start and end points of the
        loop. Different situations call for different loops.
      </p>
      <h2>Loopy loop loops üçÉ</h2>

      <p>These are the loops I know...</p>

      <h2>For loops!</h2>

      <ul>Use a for loop when you know how many times the loop should run.</ul>

      <li>Use a for loop when you supply the input</li>
      <li>Use a for loop when the increment value is standard</li>

      <h3>Example</h3>

      <p>
        If we want to check the grade of every student in the class, we loop
        from 1 to the number of students in the class.
      </p>

      <h2>While loops!</h2>
      <ul>
        A "While" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown
        number of times, until a condition is met.
      </ul>
      <li>Use a while loop when asking for user input.</li>
      <li>Use a while loop when the increment value is nonstandard.</li>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        If we want to ask a user for a number between 1 and 10, we don't know
        how many times the user may enter a larger number, so we keep asking
        "while the number is not between 1 and 10".
      </p>

      <h2>For loop vs while loop</h2>
      <p>
        The while loop has a looser syntax and the for loop has a more rigid
        syntax. A while loop expects some sort of modification to the variable
        in the body, whereas the for loop‚Äôs definition should contain
        everything.
      </p>
      <h2>Quick tips</h2>

      <li>Use a for loop to iterate over an array.</li>
      <li>Use a for loop when you know the loop should execute¬†*n*¬†times.</li>
      <li>Use a while loop for reading a file into a variable.</li>
      <li>Use a while loop when asking for user input.</li>
      <li>Use a while loop when the increment value is nonstandard.</li>

      <h2>Nested loops</h2>
      <p>
        Nested loops are loops inside of loops! You can create a loop inside any
        statement, so it follows that you can create loops inside of loops.
        Avoid nest loops as much as possible, they slow down code execution (bad
        code efficiency). And, they make your code harder to read üòû
      </p>
      <h2>Manipulating loops</h2>
      <p>
        You can end a loop early, or skip iterations by using the **break** and
        **continue** statements respectively.
      </p>
      <h2>Break</h2>
      <p>
        The break statement exits a switch statement or a loop (for, for ... in,
        while, do ... while). When the break statement is used in a loop, it
        breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop (if
        any).
      </p>
      <h3>Syntax:</h3>
      <CodeBlock language="markup" code="break;" />
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <CodeBlock language="js" code={code} />
      <p>The loop will stop when the variable i is equal to 3.</p>
      <h2>Continue</h2>
      <p>
        The continue statement skips an iteration and continues on to the next.
        Use continue combined with a condition.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock language="js" code={code2} />
      <p>Loops through a block of code, but skips multiple of 3.</p>
